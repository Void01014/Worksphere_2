Overview

This project is a web application I built to help companies manage the location and assignment of their employees.
The app lets you add new workers, organize them by role, and assign each one to their designated area or room.

Filter workers based on their roles to find the right person quickly

Real-time UI updates when moving people around

Simple and clean interface for quick internal use

Technologie used:

-HTML / TailwindCSS for the UI
